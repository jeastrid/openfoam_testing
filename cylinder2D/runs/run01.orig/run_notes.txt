- grid: cylinder_snappy (33,824 cells)
- cylinder diameter = 0.5 m
- 2 m/s inflow
- nu = 0.001 m^2/s
- Re = 1000
- Turbulence variable BCs/ICs calculated with:
  - U = 2 m/s
  - TL = 0.5 m
  - Tu = 1%

Note: setting nNonOrthogonalCorrectors 1 smooths the pressure residual a bit but
does not seem to affect convergence
